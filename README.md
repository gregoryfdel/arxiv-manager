# Arxiv RSS Manager
An rss arxiv reader created using Godot, which allows one to build up a database of [arxiv articles](https://arxiv.org/); now with added support for [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) entries.

### ADS Warning
It will get stuck in an infinite loop if it either can't find a bibcode or you do not input bibcodes

## Exported Binaries
Download the Godot 3.1 Engine Release from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/). Then open this as a new project, if you want a stand-alone executable; [export the project](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/exporting_projects.html)
